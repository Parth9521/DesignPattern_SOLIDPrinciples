What is solid principles?

SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin. These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows. Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software development.

SOLID stands for:
    • S - Single Responsibility Principle
    • O - Open Closed Principle
    • L - Liskov Substitution Principle
    • I - Interface Segregation Principle
    • D - Dependency Inversion Principle

WHY SOLID PRINCIPLES-

1.SOLID principles are come into picture because these are the
design principles that help us in encouraging creating more
maintainable, understandable, and flexible software.

2.It also helps us in growing our application according to the
size, and can reduce the complexity of the code.

The principles in which I have worked on are:
    1.  Single Responsibility Principle.
    2. Open Closed Principle
    3. Liskov Substitution Principle.
